	<h3>Getting You Started</h3>
	<p>We&#8217;ve activated our two most popular modules so you can start enjoying BuddyPress immediately; Activity Streams and Community Profiles.
	<p><strong>Activity Streams</strong> give your members a central place to discuss and comment on what other members are doing on your site. Activity Streams also provide Twitter-style @mentions and favouriting.</p>
	<p><strong>Extended Profiles</strong> are fully editadble profile field that allow you to define the fields that your members will use to describe themselves. Tailor profile fields to suit your audience.</p>
	<p>Here are quick introductions to these features; they only take a few minutes to learn, so you'll be up and ready in no time! Once you're up to speed, be sure to check out the other modules that BuddyPress offers.</p>
