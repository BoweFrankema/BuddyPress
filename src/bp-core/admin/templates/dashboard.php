		<p>We&#8217;ve activated our two most popular modules so you can start enjoying BuddyPress immediately; Activity Streams and Community Profiles.
		<p><strong>Activity Streams</strong> give your members a central place to discuss and comment on what other members are doing on your site. Activity Streams also provide Twitter-style @mentions and favouriting.</p>
		<p><strong>Extended Profiles</strong> are fully editadble profile field that allow you to define the fields that your members will use to describe themselves. Tailor profile fields to suit your audience.</p>
		<p>Here are quick introductions to these features; they only take a few minutes to learn, so you'll be up and ready in no time!</p>
